## What to Create

- To create a design for a UI Element you have to create a HTML file, and add the metadata in the ui-elements.json file.
- Write the HTML file without &lt;html&gt;,&lt;head&gt;,&lt;body&gt; tags.  
- Write the HTML codes inside a &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  
- Wrtie CSS codes as internal CSS in the &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;, and Javascript code in the &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
- Avoid inline style

Check this sample code

```html

<div>
    <!-- Write HTML Code of your design here -->
</div>

<style>
    /* Write CSS code of your design here */
</style>    

<script>
    // Write Javascript code of your design here
</script>


```

## Where to Create

- The HTML file should be saved in the directory corresponding to the ui element.  
- For example,   
If you are creating a button, save the HTML file in the __buttons/__ directory.  
- You can create and submit multiple designs at a time. If you are creating multiple designs at a time you should create HTML file for each design.  

## Naming Rules

- Name each file in the following format :  

    __github_username-design_name.html__  

- If you are creating multiple designs, each design name should be different.  
- Always add your github username with the file name to avoid duplicate names.
- Avoid using whitespaces while naming use _ or - instead.


## Adding Metadata

- Add the information about the design in the ui-elements.json file in the following format :   

- Add the theme according to the color of your element.  
- For example,  
    - If the button color is white, theme should be dark.
    - If the color matches with both light and dark themes write theme as both.

```json
{
    "element": [
        {
            "username": "Your github username",
            "name": "Design Name",
            "theme": "light", // For light theme
            "file": "github_username-design_name.html",
        }
    ]
}
```
